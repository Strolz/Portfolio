                        <p class="inspiration__text">
                        A Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum not only created Python but also served as its “Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL) until stepping down on July 12, 2018. Over his career, he worked at several major research institutions, including Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). From 2005 to 2012, Guido worked at Google, spending half his time improving the Python language. In 2013, he joined Dropbox, where he continued contributing to Python until his retirement in 2019. That retirement didn’t last long—he returned in 2020 to join Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer, where he continues to influence the language he created.
                        On a personal note, my biggest takeaway from researching Guido is his commitment, collaboration, and contribution to the world of development. The reach of his influence is truly astonishing.

                    <p class="inspiration__text">
                        Timothy John Berners‑Lee, also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, along with foundational technologies such as HTML, the URL system, and HTTP. He proposed his information‑management system on March 12, 1989, and later that year achieved the first successful communication between an HTTP client and server over the Internet. Berners‑Lee has long been a leading advocate for net neutrality, arguing that Internet service providers should offer “connectivity with no strings attached,” free from control or surveillance without explicit user consent.
                        Over the course of his career, Tim has received numerous awards and honors. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours “for services to the global development of the Internet,” and was formally invested on 16 July 2004.
                        In short, Sir Timothy John Berners‑Lee was not only a visionary — he was a modern‑age crusader for openness, universal access, and the principles that continue to shape the Internet today.
